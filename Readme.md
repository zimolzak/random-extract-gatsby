# Random Extract of Great Gatsby

Download a famous English book. Pick a random starting place. Extract
a paragraph (or more, if we are among short paragraphs).

Usage: `make`

I use it to copy/paste the text into a nice, full-featured web Morse
code translator, so I can practice receiving natural English
sentences. I make the font really small before running `make`, so that
I don't accidentally cheat and read the words before receiving.
